## Task Description:

Deep Learning Project Using PyTorch-
Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Movie Reviews using LSTM in PyTorch
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks in PyTorch to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset, which consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

 Project Tasks:
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
2. Model Development
3. Training the Model
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model Saving (Optional)
6. (Optional Extensions)
Add support for GPU (CUDA)
Wrap the model into a Flask/FastAPI web service for real-time predictions
Replace LSTM with GRU or Transformers (BERT)

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyTorch** (for model building and training)
- **TorchText** (for dataset and preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib** (optional, for visualization)
- **Jupyter / VS Code / CLI** (for development)
